# 1. What is ES6 and what are the new features introduced in ES6?
ES6, or ECMAScript 2015, heralds a grand transformation in JavaScript, imbuing the language with potent new capabilities. Among its illustrious innovations are let and const for variable declaration, arrow functions for succinct syntax, template literals for enhanced string manipulation, and destructuring assignments for streamlined data handling. Additionally, it bestows classes and modules, enhancing object-oriented programming and modularization. Promises elevate asynchronous programming, while the spread operator and rest parameters afford elegant function and array operations. ES6 thus augments JavaScript's expressiveness, efficiency, and readability, a boon for developers crafting intricate applications.
# 2. Event Bubble and Event Delegation in JavaScript:
Event bubbling occurs when an event starts from the deepest target element and propagates up through its ancestors. Event delegation takes advantage of this by placing a single event listener on a parent element to manage events for all its child elements. This method reduces memory use and improves performance by minimizing the number of event listeners required. Itâ€™s an efficient way to handle events dynamically, especially when dealing with large numbers of elements.

# 3. Difference between Local Storage, Session Storage, and Cookies:
Local storage, session storage, and cookies are all used for storing data in the browser, but they differ in scope and duration. Local storage retains data indefinitely until explicitly deleted, offering ample storage space. Session storage is temporary and clears data when the browser window is closed. Cookies, with limited storage capacity, have expiration dates and are sent to the server with each request, often used for tracking and maintaining user sessions. Each has unique advantages depending on the data persistence and scope required.

# 4. Difference between Display Inline, Display Inline-Block, and Display Block in CSS:
The `display` property in CSS determines how elements are rendered. `display: inline` places elements in a line, allowing them to flow with surrounding content without breaking lines. `display: inline-block` combines the flow of inline elements with the ability to set width and height. `display: block` stacks elements vertically, each occupying the full width of its container. These display types control the layout and behavior of elements, providing flexibility in web design.

# 5. New Features in CSS3:
CSS3 introduced a host of new features that revolutionized web design. Transitions and animations bring dynamic changes and movement to elements. Media queries enable responsive design, allowing layouts to adapt to various screen sizes. Flexbox and grid layouts provide powerful tools for complex layouts. Shadows, gradients, and border-radius add aesthetic enhancements. These features collectively enhance the visual appeal and functionality of websites, making CSS3 a significant upgrade for modern web development.
